Hello this is the read me for assignment 4 
For bootstrap a quick summary of the things i did was instead of using css for making my borders with the pics 
and caption is i used bootstrap and used the grid system i used the column
small class and also used a new navigation bar instead of doing it with css
for a better responsive look when resizing or when using mobile
